1. Viewing User Accounts:
Use the cat or less command to view the /etc/passwd file which contains information about user accounts. Each line represents a user account with fields separated by colons (:). The fields typically include username, password (usually 'x' indicating stored in /etc/shadow), user ID (UID), group ID (GID), user's full name or description, home directory, and default shell.
bash

	cat /etc/passwd

2.Viewing Group Information:
Similarly, group information is stored in the /etc/group file. Each line represents a group with fields separated by colons (:). The fields typically include group name, group password (usually 'x' indicating stored in /etc/gshadow), GID, and a comma-separated list of usernames that are members of the group.
bash

	cat /etc/group

3. Listing Users:
Use the getent command to list all users on the system.

	getent passwd

4. Listing Groups:
Use the getent command to list all groups on the system.

	getent group

5. Viewing User's Group Memberships:
To check which groups a specific user belongs to, you can use the groups command followed by the username.
bash

	groups username

6. Checking User's Details:
Use the id command followed by the username to get detailed information about a specific user, including UID, GID, and group memberships.
bash

	id username

7. Checking User's Last Login Information:
Use the lastlog command to view the last login information for all users.

	lastlog

8. Analyzing Home Directories:
Inspect the contents of user home directories to understand their configurations and stored files.
bash

	ls -l /home

9. Reviewing System Configuration Files:
Review configuration files such as 
	/etc/passwd 
	/etc/group
	/etc/shadow 
for user and group information. Understand the permissions and configurations set for each user and group.

10. Checking User Privileges:
Review the /etc/sudoers file to see which users have sudo privileges.

	cat /etc/sudoers
