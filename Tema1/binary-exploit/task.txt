# Casino

Hey there, fellow gambler,

Are you good with them numbers? If so, you can try your skills on our new
virtual casino, headquartered in Saint Tropez!

You will have plenty of fun and, if you are lucky enough, you win lots of
SpeishCoins!

You can also train locally using the attached program.

When you are ready to play the real game, the official casino is at the
following address (use a TCP network client to connect):
`isc2023.1337.cx:10026`.

Let's see if you have what it takes!


### Hints:

  - you don't have the source code :P #ghidra / #iaito (or IDA Pro + HexRays if you got $$)
  - you should use some tooling on this one (e.g., python + pwntools);
  - there are [at least] two buffer overflows! first may be used for reading 
    memory (i.e., leaks), second one for control flow hijack!
  - extra hint: use `tee` and always inspect output in a hex viewer!
  - note: ROP gadgets may not be sufficient for an easy solution :P
  - after succeeding locally, make sure to run your exploit on the server!
  - you can use netcat (`nc`) or pwntools' `remote()` for opening a socket pipe with
    the server ;)
